For installation:
1. Run the setup.msi file
2. Go into the windows program directory in which the application was installed
3. Click on the VSTO file to install the Excel Addin. Ignore the warning "unknown publisher".

For deinstallation:
1. Look for "Setup Excel Statistics Addin" and "Excel Statistics Addin" in "Add or remove programs" 
2. Click on "remove" for both.

These are the steps on Windows 10. It may be slightly different for other versions of Windows.
